# Online Bookstore

The Program sells two types of Books: Text Books and audio Books.

## Description

a Text book, keep track of the ID (int) ,title(String) , release Date (java.util.Date) , price(double), and number of pages(int). 

For an Audio Book, keep track of the ID (int) ,title (String), release Date (java.util.Date), price (double), and the length in minutes (double). 

The ID is just a serial number initialized at construction time. This means that the first Book object constructed should have id= 1 and the second one id= 2, and so on.

All the classes provide a print method and accessor methods for all their fields.

All classes override the toString and Equals (neglect price in comparison) methods appropriately.
