# OOP Projects

### Summary of all projects presented in the Java language using the OOP 

### using the four principles of object-oriented programming : abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
## 2D Line

The Program have classes that represents a 2D-Line.

A 2D-Line is composed of a 2D-point that represents a position and a 2D-Vector that represents the direction.

## Average Of Vectors

The Program takes an array of vectors and returns their average magnitude.

The class represents a 2D Vector and encapsulate both X-Component and Y-Component.

## Bank Account

The Program application representing a bank account.

The class encapsulate an account number , an account holder name , a balance , flag indicating whether the account is closed or open.

## Canvas

The Program representing three Geometric shapes Line , Rectangle and Ellipse and represents a Canvas.

A Canvas has multiple shapes (use ArrayList).

The Class have : Add shape , Remove shape , Get shape , draw All.

## Geometric Shapes

The Program Computes and Prints both its area and perimeter.

## Moveable

The Program application represents a new shape type called Diamond.

have an interface called Moveable with a single method.

## Online Bookstore

The Program sells two types of Books: Text Books and audio Books.

a Text book, keep track of the ID ,title, release Date, price, and number of pages.

For an Audio Book, keep track of the ID ,title, release Date , price, and the length in minutes.

## String Buffer

The Program define and test the mutable String class.

the class have a private reference to an array of characters allocated at construction time (based on a passed String).

## Sum of an Array

The Program computes and returns the sum of an array of integers.

## Triangular Shape

The Program Print '*' in Triangular Shape

## Two Double Values

The Program application that accepts two double values from the user, then print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

The application use exception handling to verify that the numbers are actually double values.

In case the provided inputs are invalid, the program should allow the user to retry until he enters double values.

## Two Integers

The Program application that accepts two integers from the user, then print their sum, difference, product, quotient, and division remainder.

The application use exception handling to verify that the numbers are actually integers.

In case the provided inputs are invalid, the program should allow the user to retry until he enters integers.
