# Canvas and Geometric shapes

The Program representing three Geometric shapes Line , Rectangle and Ellipse and represents a Canvas.

## Description

#### Three Classes :

• Line: with a start (javafx.geometry.Point2D) and end (javafx.geometry.Point2D).

• Rectangle: with a start (javafx.geometry.Point2D), length (double) and width (double).

• Ellipse: with a start (javafx.geometry.Point2D), length (double) and width (double).

All classes  have a public constructor, accessors to all fields. 

All shapes  have a draw() method which is specific to every shape type, it should simply prints the shape information. 

For each class and each method defined, it can be declared as abstract/final.

#### A Canvas has multiple shapes (use ArrayList). 

The Class have The following methods :

• Add shape: Add new shape to the canvas.

• Remove shape: remove a shape from the canvas.

• Get shape: returns the closest shape to a given (javafx.geometry.Point2D)

• draw All : Simply draw all Canvas shapes.
